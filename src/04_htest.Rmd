## Analysis

To answer our question, we will perform a hypothesis testing. First, we'll define $H_0$ and $H_A$ as below:

$H_0:$ the proportion of athletes under 25 that win a medal is equal to the proportion of athletes 25 and older that win a medal.

$H_A:$ the proportion of athletes under 25 that win a medal is greater to the proportion of athletes 25 and older that win a medal.

We will then

1\. compute the observed test statistic from original sample,

2\. use the null model to generate 100 random permuted samples from the original sample and calculate their corresponding r test statistics,

3\. generate the null distribution using these r test statistics,

4\. check if the observed test statistic computed in (1) falls on the distribution,

5\. calculate the p-value to verify the result

The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found here: [https://github.com/UBC-MDS/olympic_medal_htes](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/olympic_medal_htest/blob/main/results/03_EDA.Rmd)t

## Results & Discussion

```{r testing-result, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Hypothesis testing result", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/04_h0_dist.png")
```

From figure 1, we can see that the observed test statistics (red line) fall within the significance threshold (blue line), we fail to reject $H_0$.

```{r p_value result, echo=FALSE}
kable(p_value$p_value, caption = "Table 1. p-value for the test.", col.names = 'p-value') |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

The p-value calculated is 1 and it is higher than the $\alpha$ of 0.05. It leads us to the same conclusion:

We fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the proportion of athletes younger than 25 that win a medal is equal to the proportion of athletes of age 25 or older that win a medal.
