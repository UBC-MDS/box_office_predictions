# Contributing to the Box Office Predictions project

This outlines how to propose a change to the Box Office Predictions
project.

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited
directly using the GitHub web interface. Other major errors should
always be filed a GitHub issue and the project team members will verify
the suggestions and update accordingly.

### Prerequisites

When you initiate a substantial pull request, you should always file an
issue and agree with a project team member on whether the changes are
appropriate. If you've found a bug, create an issue and illustrate the
bug with a minimal reproducible example.

### Pull request process

-   We recommend that you push to your fork repo and then initiate a
    pull request (PR).
-   New code should follow the tidyverse [style
    guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style
    guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
